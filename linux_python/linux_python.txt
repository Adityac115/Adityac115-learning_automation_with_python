we can use some feature of linux in python as

we can use : * and ? in python using import glob 
it works as expected in python as it works in linux
how we use them in linux e.g:

echo a*       #prints all the files starting with a in that directory

echo *.py     #prints all the file ends with .py in that directory

echo *        #prints all files in that directory
 
echo ????.py    #prints all the files that have 4 characters and then ends with .py in that directory


how you can you them in python :

print(glob.glob ('a*     ')       #prints all the files starting with a in that directory

print(glob.glob ('*.py   ')       #prints all the file ends with .py in that directory

print(glob.glob ('*      ')        #prints all files in that directory

print(glob.glob ('????.py')          #prints all the files that have 4 characters and then ends with .py in that directory
